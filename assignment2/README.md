#Introduction

OfferUp is a online resale market that was created as a competitor to Craigslist. Although it offers both an app and website version, it has a mobile first design. The app carries an emphasis on in-person transactions.

A usability test is intended to determine the extent an interface facilitates a userâ€™s ability to complete routine tasks. Typically the test is conducted with a group of potential users either in a usability lab, remotely (using e-meeting software and telephone connection), or on-site with portable equipment. Users are asked to complete a series of routine tasks. Sessions are recorded and analyzed to identify potential areas for improvement to the web site. 

Prior to the usability test, I conducted a heuristic evaluation that revealed several usability issues with the app. First of all, the ads are difficult to differentiate from actual listings. If you click them, they open a new window outside the app. This is can be disruptive and frustrating for users, especially if they click them by accident. Moreover, error messages do not provide enough information for users to identify and solve problems. Instead, they only provide an error number. In addition, there's no method for deleting listings, only archiving listings.
