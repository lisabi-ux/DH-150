## Introduction

OfferUp is an online resale market that was created as a competitor to Craigslist. Although it offers both an app and website version, it has a mobile first design. The app carries an emphasis on in-person transactions.

A usability test is intended to determine the extent an interface facilitates a userâ€™s ability to complete routine tasks. Typically the test is conducted with a group of potential users either in a usability lab, remotely (using e-meeting software and telephone connection), or on-site with portable equipment. Users are asked to complete a series of routine tasks. Sessions are recorded and analyzed to identify potential areas for improvement to the web site. 

Prior to the usability test, I conducted a heuristic evaluation that revealed several usability issues with the app:
* The ads are difficult to differentiate from actual listings. If you click them, they open a new window outside the app. This is can be disruptive and frustrating for users, especially if they click them by accident. 
* Error messages do not provide enough information for users to identify and solve problems. Instead, they only provide an error number.
* There's no method for deleting listings, only archiving listings. 

Based on these initial findings, I hoped to find out how these aspects effect the usability of the app by conducting pilot usability testing. In addition, I also hoped to test the overall effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction that the app does or does not provide. I also wanted to uncover any issues that I may have missed in my heuristic evaluation. The overall purpose of the pilot usability testing was to test the setting and materials and discover ways to improve the app.

## Methodology

The pilot usability testing was conducted at the participant's home in Riverside, California, using a portable minimalistic lab. As the moderator, I sat adjacent to the participant. The testing was conducted using a live app version of OfferUp on an iPhone, which was screenrecorded in order to see the participant's navigation choices. In addition, a laptop was used to record the participant's facial expressions and comments. During the usability test, the participant also completed an accompanying survey, which was also screen recorded. 

After explaining the purpose of the usability test and obtaining consent from the participant, we began the usability test. This began with a pre-test background questionnaire which measured the participant's prior familiarity with the app and their initial reaction to the app. Following this, the participant completed three tasks in the app: searching for an item with filtering, saving items for later viewing, and listing then unlisting an item. After the task portion, the participant completed a post-test questionnaire which measured the participant's opinion of the app, such as the app's ease of use and complexity. Finally, the participant completed a demographics survey.

## Reflection

Overall, the pilot usability test gave me valuable insight into both the app itself the usability testing process. The usability test confirmed and also revealed several issues. It confirmed some of the things that I had suspected would cause issues, such as the disruptive ads and the difficulty in unlisting items. It also revealed several other issues, such as the lack of system status while searching as far as shipping vs. pickup method, and the fact that notifications persist in the inbox even after they're resolved, which can create confusion. As far as the testing process itself, there were points at which the participant got frustrated and would ask me what to do and whether she was doing the right thing, which I wasn't always sure how to answer since I didn't want to bias her. In addition, there were points at which she wanted to skip tasks that she couldn't figure out, but I encouraged her to keep trying a bit more. In the future, I would like to create a more casual and conversational atmosphere, which would put less pressure on the participant. I would also take more time to prepare the script, so that I can explain the process to the participant well.
