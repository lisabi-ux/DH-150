## DH 150 Assignment 05: Persona + Scenario for an Online Resale Market

### Purpose of UX Storytelling

The purpose of UX Storytelling is to help designers understand and empathize with the users of their products. UX Storytelling involves taking user data and repackaging it in a way that makes it clear and memorable, allowing UX designers to more effectively communicate insights from research and see things from users' perspective. It can be difficult to understand insights from raw data or bullet points â€” UX Storytelling instead communicates this information in a way that is memorable, easier to understand, and more likely to resonate, because storytelling is a powerful tool for communication.

### User Scenarios and Journey Maps

#### Erin's Scenario

* Erin is a undergraduate college student who is studying Economics. At the start of her third year, she decides it's time to move out and into an apartment for the first time. Since she's never lived on her own before, it's an intimidating and stressful process. A month before her move-in date, she decides it's time to start looking for furniture for her new apartment. As a college student, her only source of income is from her part-time minimum wage job, so her budget is very restricted. To save money, she decides she wants to buy her furniture second hand. After seeing an add for an online resale market, she decides to check it out and see if she can find quality, affordable furniture there.
* Visiting the page, she types "couch" in the search bar. At first, she is overwhelmed with all the information. There are couches of all forms, colors, and materials. Moreover, some couches are clearly more worn out than others. And since she's new to the website, she's not entirely sure how trustworthy it is. With her low budget and price of furniture, she's apprehensive about buying furniture from a stranger on a website. Used furniture could be poor quality, or it could even have bed bugs. Moreover, the internet is strife with scammers. As of now, she's unsure how to feel about what she's seeing. 
* After scanning the page, she realizes that there's a filter button at the top of the search page. She filters the search so that she only sees white sectional couches with removable covers, which is her preference. She also filters the search so that she only sees couches categorized as "good" or "excellent," since she wants a couch in good condition. Finally, she sets the price at $150, since that is her budget for a couch. She also sees a small tick icon, denoting location filtering. On a tight budget, she doesn't want to spend a lot of money on transportation. Therefore, she sets the location to within 5 miles of her current location. This way, she only sees items that are local. With filtering set, she's able to see couches that tailor to her specific preferences, making the search easy. After finding an affordable couch in her area, she checks the seller's profile to see his information and prior reviews. This way, she can assess his trustworthiness.
* With her preferences met, she decides to buy the couch. Erin is excited to find a couch that met all her goals and preferences: affordable, good price, and nearby. She is glad to have dealt with a trustworthy seller, and is looking forward to buying more used furniture tailored to her needs for her new apartment.

#### June's Scenario

* June is a nurse who works at a local hospital. After getting a promotion, she decides it's time to remodel her house, especially since her two kids are getting older and growing out of their furniture. She orders furniture from a local store, but before the furniture arrives, she wants to get rid of her old furniture. She thinks about giving it away, but she doesn't know anyone who needs kids furniture. She thinks about just throwing it away, but that would be wasteful. Therefore, she decides to try to sell her old furniture. That way, the furniture gets more use, and she can earn some extra cash too. After being recommended it by a friend, she decides to use an online resale market to list her furniture.
* June decides to make an account to sell the furniture. However, June has many items to sell, and quickly gets overwhelmed with the idea of listing them all. As a working mom, she doesn't have a ton of time to list a bunch of items that aren't even guaranteed to sell. Moreover, she's not exactly tech savvy, so using a new platform can be intimidating and slow. 
* Nevertheless, excited to start selling, June clicks the "Sell" button and lists the first item, a couch. While listing the item, she realizes that the listing process is extremely simple and quick, especially since there are preset categories that she can choose from. She picks a category for the item and sets the location so that customers close by will see it. She checks the "Pick Up Only" button so that she doesn't have to worry about shipping. After listing the first item, she realizes that she can easily copy listings, by clicking the vertical dots on the listing and clicking "copy listing." She can also find this option by clicking the "Sell" button. That way, if she is selling several items of a similar type, she can list them quickly by copying the listing and changing key elements, such as the picture and title. 
* Within a few days, June gets several offers on her items. She's picks buyers who offer decent prices and have trustworthy profiles. June is happy to sell her furniture in a way that is hassle free, and she is glad to have gotten rid of her old furniture to make room for her new furniture. She feels satisfied with the prices she sold them at, and glad to have found trustworthy buyers. Since she listed them as pick up only, the buyers come to pick up the furniture, which makes things easier for her, since she doesn't need to transport or ship the furniture.
