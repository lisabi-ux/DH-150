### Purpose of UX Storytelling

The purpose of UX Storytelling is to help designers understand and empathize with the users of their products. UX Storytelling involves taking user data and repackaging it in a way that makes it clear and memorable, allowing UX designers to more effectively communicate insights from research and see things from users' perspective. It can be difficult to understand insights from raw data or bullet points â€” UX Storytelling instead communicates this information in a way that is memorable, easier to understand, and more likely to resonate, because storytelling is a powerful tool for communication.

#### June's Scenario

* June is a nurse who works at a local hospital. After getting a promotion, she decides it's time to remodel her house, especially since her two kids are getting older and growing out of their furniture. She orders furniture from a local store, but before the furniture arrives, she wants to get rid of her old furniture. She thinks about giving it away, but she doesn't know anyone who needs kids furniture. She thinks about just throwing it away, but that would be wasteful, especially since she could get some money back by selling it.
