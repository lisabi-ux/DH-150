# Assignment 08: High Fidelity Prototype

## Description
Tradepost is a second hand furniture resale market that aims to provide a quick and easy way for users to buy and sell their furniture. The purpose of this high-fidelity prototype is to implement the visual aspects of the design and study their effect on the user's experience. We will pay special attention to aspects such as color, typography, readibility, and visual heirarchy. This process involves designing a high-fidelity prototype with wireframes, implementing an interactive prototype, and conducting an impression test to assess users' immediate reaction to the design. Based on this feedback, I will assess possible changes that could improve the prototype.

## Wireframes

## Graphic Design
When designing the visual aesthetic of the graphic, my goal was to create a clean, organized, and cohesive interface design. To reach this goal, I made sure to implement a minialistic style across the app, without unneccessary embellishments. 

### Color
In order to create a minimalistic and clean design, I decided to use a fairly limited color palette for the interface. For the purpose of readability, I decided that the base of the interface should be white. In addition, I decided that the accent color would be a deep blue (#6524FB). My reasoning behind this decision is that blue is a color that is popular with both men and women, and I wanted to appeal to a broad audience. Although people do not usually consciously pick apps and websites based on color, color can definitely play a part in the subconscious decisions of users. Therefore, I wanted to pick a popular color with broad appeal. Moreover, a deep blue is highly contrasting on a white background, which aides in readability. A deep blue can be differentiated from black and gray text, so it can be used to attract users' attention to important buttons. I used this color relatively sparingly, using it only for important features such as the tabs, the navigation bar icons, and buttons involved with making and accepting offers. I did not want to overuse the color because otherwise it would lose it's affect as an attention signaler. 

Headings, tabs, and titles of listings are dark gray (#414141). This color is dark enough to provide good contrast and ensure readability, but it is not pure black, which can cause eye strain. The text of message previews is slightly lighter (#707070), to create hierarchy and differentiation. Since the inbox will contain a lot of text, a slightly lighter color for the message preview ensures that users are not as overwhelmed with processing lots of visual information. Moreover, it helps to differentiate the name of the message sender from the body of the message. 

Other colors were used in limited ways. A dark teal (#026F83) was used to indicate the condition of products. This helps differentiate it from the rest of the listing, and attracts the user's attention. At first, I had used a lighter teal (#0C96D3), but this color did not provide enough contrast with the background, since it was too light. A dark green color (#317B11) was used in the messages tab to indicate messages from potential buyers. A cobalt blue color (#1552D9) was used to indicate messages from sellers.

All colors passed the color contrast test:

### Font 

Since I chose a relatively limited color palette, I primarily used font weights to differentiate important headings, signalers, and buttons. The primary font I used was Monserrat. I picked this font because it is modern and stylish, while still being easily readable and user friendly. For important titles and headings, I used Monserrat Bold and Monserrat Semibold. For certain important buttons, such as the login, sign up, and make an offfer button, I used Monserrat Semibold Italics. This makes the button more distinct and attention grabbing, and differentiates these buttons from other features. For the text of listing descriptions, profile descriptions, and the body of messages, I used Helvetica Neue. This font is suitable for large bodies of text because it is very readable and very familiar to users, due to it's broad use among apps and websites. 

Examples of text from the interface are shown below:

## Impression Test
A video of the impression test can be found [here](https://youtu.be/ahjpU1JBLEw).

The impression test was conducted virtually over zoom. The participant was given a link to view the wireframes, and asked about their initial reaction and thoughts. Key findings included:
* The participant was able to easily identify the purpose of the app as a furniture resale market.
* The three adjectives they chose to describe the app were upscale, approachable, and clean. (After asking them to explain their reasoning, it seemed like their reason for choosing 'upscale,' was the furniture pictures rather than the actual interface)
* The participant was able to accurately identify the main feature and services that the app offers, mainly that users can buy and sell used furniture, but they did not name more specific features.
* The participant described the feel of the interface as professional.

A key takeaway from the impression test that grabbed my attention was that it may come off as upscale looking. I believe that this descriptor was mainly brought up by the participant because of the professional looking photographs used in the prototype. However, if the interface itself is also too upscale, this may make the app less approachable. Since this app is a resale market aimed at lower class and middle class populations, this may make the app feel inaccessible and less appealing. Other than that, the user seemed to have a positive impression of the app, and was able to identify the purpose easily.

## Interactive Prototype

The prototype can be viewed [here](https://xd.adobe.com/view/fe671d1e-871f-4a37-ba05-65c8395acb69-ab34/).
The interactive prototype was created using Adobe XD. Tasks such as searching, filtering, posting listings, favoriting listings, and viewing profiles is supported with the prototype. The interactive prototype supports several tasks:

* Searching & Filtering
* Listing Items
* Viewing & Accepting Offers
* Viewing Profiles
* Viewing Favorites

## Cognitive Walkthrough

The cognitive walkthrough was conducted remotely. Users viewed the prototype, and then answered a questionairre about their impression, understanding, and confusions about the app. In this case, the participant was able to identify that the app is used to exchange furniture, based on the splash screen. They were also accurately able to infer that users are able to list items and buy other users' items. The user did not have trouble or confusion when completing the tasks. Based on these results, the high-fidelity prototype has good usability and accurately conveys the purpose and affordances of the app.
