## Step 01: Specify the main design challenge

#### What is the main activity your project would support the users’ needs?
The main activity my project supports is allowing users to buy second-hand items, and sell their own items. 

#### What is the basic need involved for that activity?
The activity fulfills the users safety need because buying things second hand rather than new and selling used items rather than throwing them away is beneficial for financial security and economic safety.

#### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
The most popular solution used currently are online marketplaces, such as Facebook marketplace and Craigslist. Depop and Poshmark are also popular solutions, with a younger and more female demographic and product selection than Facebook marketplace and Craigslist.

#### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
A certain limitation is that users are often suspicious of buying or selling from unverified strangers. These online marketplaces sometimes lack any system for user reviews. Users are unsure of whether they can trust other users, for fear of scams or low-quality items. This can make them less likely to utilize the platform. This is especially the case because most sellers do not allow returns.

## Step 02: Target users 
#### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise) 
Demographics: Adults of lower to middle income, college students, working class & middle class.
Preference: People want to acquire things for lower prices, and want to sell the belongings that they don't need.
Expertise: No particular level of expertise should be needed.
#### Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)
Users who are looking to buy items can do this anywhere, provided they have a smartphone or laptop. Users who are looking to sell their things will probably do this at home, since you must take pictures of the things you are selling.
#### What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)
To buy an item, the user would search and browse the marketplace, likely comparing different items until they settle on the one they like the best, with a price that they're satisfied with and a trustworthy seller. To sell an item, users would take pictures of the item, then list it on the marketplace, providing a description with details about the item.

## Step 03: Pick research methods
I decided to use two methods: interview and participatory observation. 
For the participatory observation, I observed two activities:
* Searching an selecting an item: I asked the participant to search for an item they often buy, and speak through their process of how they would select one to buy.
* Listing an item: I asked the participant to list an item they often sell, and speak through their process of writing the title and description, and their thought process for picking a price.
These activities were conducted in the participant's home, in order to have the most comfortable and natural environment. This is the context where they would normally use a resale marketplace. The interview was recorded using a macbook pro, and the activities were conducted on Depop using an iPhone, which was screenrecorded. Depop was selected because it was the platform the user was most familiar with.

### Interesting quotes and insights from the interview:
#### :one: Trustworthiness matters. User profiles and reviews add to trustworthiness.
> *Interviewer: When you find an item that you like, how important is the user’s profile/prior reviews to you? Do they play a part in your decision making? <br/>
> Participant: It matters a little bit. This person doesn’t have any reviews and not a lot of followers. <br/>
> Interviewer: If the seller did not have any reviews, would you be discouraged from purchasing from them? <br/>
> Participant: Yeah, especially if they’re charging a lot.* <br/>
  
The user also felt more trusting of Facebook Marketplace over Craigslist because Facebook allows you to look at the seller's profile, while Craigslist is completely anonymous.

#### :two: Feedback and interaction makes makes the platform more appealing. Lack of interaction can be discouraging.
> *I’d probably trust Facebook over Craigslist because I’ve had more luck selling my stuff on Facebook...Response time is usually faster too.* <br/>

> *Interviewer: How do you feel when you [list an item]? <br/>
> Participant: I get excited about it, especially seeing people heart it.* <br/>

> *Interviewer: When someone has an item they don’t want, what do you think is the biggest barrier that stops people from selling their items? <br/>
> Participant: They don’t want to put the clothes on, take the pictures, because the chances of you selling is pretty low. The ratio of sellers to buyers is high, there’s so many sellers and not a lot of buyers. If I wanted to get rid of something asap, I’d just donate it.* <br/>

#### :three: Lack of refund ability creates hesitancy, especially since used items can have defects. Sellers are not always honest about defects.
> *Interviewer: What is your favorite aspect of buying items online, and what is your least favorite? <br/>
> Participant: I don’t have to sift through things, I can look through pictures. But, sometimes I can’t tell the dimensions from the picture, or something is wrong with the product that isn’t shown, which is problematic because there’s no return policy.* <br/>


## Reflection

Overall, this activity was a valuable learning experience for understanding how and why users interact with resale marketplaces, as well as their goals and motivations for taking part in these communities. The interview confirmed to me that fascilitating trustworthiness between buyers and sellers is important, and that reputation systems can help assure users of sellers' trustworthiness. This is especially relevant because most resale markets do not allow refunds, so buyers must have confidence in sellers. An aspect that I hadn't thought of before is that feedback and interaction can encourage sellers to stay on the platform. Even if no one buys the item, likes and interaction are satisfying and allow the seller to guage customer's interest. Platforms that do not have likes or other methods of interaction may be less beneficial, since sellers may become discouraged. Through this process, I gained valuable insight into the process of user observation understanding their context of use. I found it more casual than the pilot usability test, and I felt that the user felt less pressure about taking the "correct" action. I also got to ask more questions about their preferences and opinions. In the future, I'd like to come up with more questions to specifically understand the retention of users, since resale marketplaces often have low retention rates, especially of sellers.
