# Step 1: Specify the main design challenge

## What is the main activity your project would support the usersâ€™ needs?
The main activity my project supports is allowing users to buy second-hand items, and sell their own items. 

## What is the basic need involved for that activity?
The activity fulfills the users safety need because buying things second hand rather than new and selling used items rather than throwing them away is beneficial for financial security and economic safety.

## What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
The most popular solution used currently are online marketplaces, such as Facebook marketplace and Craigslist. Depop and Poshmark are also popular solutions, with a younger and more female demographic and product selection than Facebook marketplace and Craigslist.

## What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
A certain limitation is that users are often suspicious of buying or selling from unverified strangers. These online marketplaces sometimes lack any system for user reviews. Users are unsure of whether they can trust other users, for fear of scams or low-quality items. This can make them less likely to utilize the platform.
