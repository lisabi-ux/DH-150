# Assignment 07-02: High Fidelity Prototype

Lisa Bi 

DH 150

## Description
Tradepost is a second hand furniture resale market that aims to provide a quick and easy way for users to buy and sell their furniture. The purpose of this high-fidelity prototype is to implement the visual aspects of the design and study their effect on the user's experience. We will pay special attention to aspects such as color, typography, readibility, and visual heirarchy. The high fidelity prototype was created using Adobe XD. This process involves designing a high-fidelity prototype with wireframes, implementing an interactive prototype, conducting an impression test and to assess users' immediate reaction to the design, and conducting a cognitive walkthrough to assess the usability of the app. Based on this feedback, I will assess possible changes that could improve the prototype.

## Interactive Prototype

The prototype can be viewed [here](https://xd.adobe.com/view/fe671d1e-871f-4a37-ba05-65c8395acb69-ab34/).

The interactive prototype was created using Adobe XD. The interactive prototype supports several tasks:

* Searching & Filtering
* Listing Items
* Viewing & Accepting Offers
* Viewing Profiles
* Viewing Favorites


## Graphic Design
When designing the visual aesthetic of the app, my goal was to create a clean, organized, and cohesive interface design. To reach this goal, I made sure to implement a minialistic style across the app, without unneccessary embellishments. 

### Color
In order to create a minimalistic and clean design, I decided to use a fairly limited color palette for the interface. For the purpose of readability, I decided that the base of the interface should be white. In addition, I decided that the accent color would be a deep blue (#6524FB). My reasoning behind this decision is that blue is a color that is popular with both men and women, and I wanted to appeal to a broad audience. Although people do not usually consciously pick apps and websites based on color, color can definitely play a part in the subconscious decisions of users. Therefore, I wanted to pick a popular color with broad appeal. Moreover, a deep blue is highly contrasting on a white background, which aides in readability. A deep blue can be differentiated from black and gray text, so it can be used to attract users' attention to important buttons. I used this color relatively sparingly, using it only for important features such as the tabs, the navigation bar icons, and buttons involved with making and accepting offers. I did not want to overuse the color because otherwise it would lose it's affect as a signifier. 

Headings, tabs, and titles of listings are dark gray (#414141). This color is dark enough to provide good contrast and ensure readability, but it is not pure black, which can cause eye strain. The text of message previews is slightly lighter (#707070), to create hierarchy and differentiation. Since the inbox will contain a lot of text, a slightly lighter color for the message preview ensures that users are not as overwhelmed with processing lots of visual information. Moreover, it helps to differentiate the name of the message sender from the body of the message. 

Other colors were used in limited ways. A dark teal (#026F83) was used to indicate the condition of products. This helps differentiate it from the rest of the listing, and attracts the user's attention. At first, I had used a lighter teal (#0C96D3), but this color did not provide enough contrast with the background, since it was too light. A dark green color (#317B11) was used in the messages tab to indicate messages from potential buyers. A cobalt blue color (#1552D9) was used to indicate messages from sellers.

All colors passed the color contrast test:

### Font 

Since I chose a relatively limited color palette, I primarily used font weights to differentiate important headings, signifiers, and buttons. The primary font I used was Monserrat. I picked this font because it is modern and stylish, while still being easily readable and user friendly. For important titles, headings, and buttons, I used Monserrat Bold or Monserrat Semibold. For the text of listing descriptions, profile descriptions, and the body of messages, I used Helvetica Neue. This font is suitable for large bodies of text because it is very readable and very familiar to users, due to it's broad use among apps and websites. 

Examples of text from the interface are shown below:

## Impression Test
A video of the impression test can be found [here](https://youtu.be/ahjpU1JBLEw).

The impression test was conducted virtually over zoom. The participant was given a link to view the wireframes, and asked about their initial reaction and thoughts. Key findings included:
* The participant was able to easily identify the purpose of the app as a furniture resale market.
* The three adjectives they chose to describe the app were upscale, approachable, and clean. (After asking them to explain their reasoning, it seemed like their reason for choosing 'upscale,' was the furniture pictures rather than the actual interface)
* The participant was able to accurately identify the main features and services that the app offers, mainly that users can buy and sell used furniture, but they did not name more specific features.
* The participant described the feel of the interface as professional.

A key takeaway from the impression test that grabbed my attention was that it came off as upscale looking. I believe that this descriptor was mainly brought up by the participant because of the professional looking photographs used in the prototype. However, if the interface itself is also too upscale, this may make the app less approachable. Since this app is a resale market aimed at lower class and middle class populations, this may make the app feel inaccessible and less appealing. Other than that, the user seemed to have a positive impression of the app, and was able to identify the purpose easily.


## Cognitive Walkthrough

The results of the cognitive walkthrough can be viewed [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CczkDfdihYl4FNvXsWe01qWSystnx5YN4cFVX5B1u_o/edit).

The cognitive walkthrough was conducted remotely. Users viewed the prototype, and then answered a questionairre about their impression, understanding, and confusions about the app. In this case, the participant was able to identify that the app is used to exchange furniture, based on the splash screen. They were also accurately able to infer that users are able to list items and buy other users' items. The user did not have trouble or confusion when completing the tasks. Based on these results, the high-fidelity prototype has good usability and accurately conveys the purpose and affordances of the app. 

## Reflection
Overall, the process went smoothly. Designing the high-fidelity prototype was an insightful and valuable learning experience. Testing readability through contrast tests was very useful in ensuring that the text is easily readable. The impression test was interesting and gave me important information on how the app is immediately percieved, based on first hand impressions. The cognitive walkthrough gave me information on the usability of the app and helped to identify any potential weak points and inconsistencies in the app.

Based on the results of the impression test and cognitive walkthrough, the high fidelity prototype was successful in conveying the purpose and features offered by the application. Based on the feedback of the impression test, I would like to continue to study and improve the 'feel' of the app. The participant in our impression test described the application as upscale, which I believe may be unappealing to our target users. An upscale impression may make the application feel out of reach and unsuitable for the average user. To examine this, I would like to conduct additional impression tests with different item photos in order to see whether this impression is true even with less professional looking photos. In further iterations, I would also like to continue to examine how the message and offering system can be improved. Since this feature is integral to the app, I would like to conduct additional user testing specific to this feature in order to study the usability of the current design and potential improvements that can be made.
