## Graphic Design
When designing the visual aesthetic of the graphic, my goal was to create a clean, organized, and cohesive interface design. To reach this goal, I made sure to implement a minialistic style across the app, without unneccessary embellishments. 

### Color
In order to create a minimalistic and clean design, I decided to use a fairly limited color palette for the interface. For the purpose of readability, I decided that the base of the interface should be white. In addition, I decided that the accent color would be a deep blue (#6524FB). My reasoning behind this decision is that blue is a color that is popular with both men and women, and I wanted to appeal to a broad audience. Although people do not usually consciously pick apps and websites based on color, color can definitely play a part in the subconscious decisions of users. Therefore, I wanted to pick a popular color with broad appeal. Moreover, a deep blue is highly contrasting on a white background, which aides in readability. A deep blue can be differentiated from black and gray text, so it can be used to attract users' attention to important buttons. I used this color relatively sparingly, using it only for important features such as the tabs, the navigation bar icons, and buttons involved with making and accepting offers. I did not want to overuse the color because otherwise it would lose it's affect as an attention signaler. 

Headings, tabs, and titles of listings are dark gray (#414141). This color is dark enough to provide good contrast and ensure readability, but it is not pure black, which can cause eye strain. The text of message previews is slightly lighter (#707070), to create hierarchy and differentiation. Since the inbox will contain a lot of text, a slightly lighter color for the message preview ensures that users are not as overwhelmed with processing lots of visual information. Moreover, it helps to differentiate the name of the message sender from the body of the message. 

Other colors were used in limited ways. A dark teal (#026F83) was used to indicate the condition of products. This helps differentiate it from the rest of the listing, and attracts the user's attention. At first, I had used a lighter teal (#0C96D3), but this color did not provide enough contrast with the background, since it was too light. A dark green color (#317B11) was used in the messages tab to indicate messages from potential buyers. A cobalt blue color (#1552D9) was used to indicate messages from sellers.

All colors passed the color contrast test:

### Font 

Since I chose a relatively limited color palette, I primarily used font weights to differentiate important headings, signalers, and buttons. The primary font I used was Monserrat. I picked this font because it is modern and stylish, while still being easily readable and user friendly. For important titles and headings, I used Monserrat Bold and Monserrat Semibold. For certain important buttons, such as the login, sign up, and make an offfer button, I used Monserrat Semibold Italics. This makes the button more distinct and attention grabbing, and differentiates these buttons from other features. For the text of listing descriptions, profile descriptions, and the body of messages, I used Helvetica Neue. This font is suitable for large bodies of text because it is very readable and very familiar to users, due to it's broad use among apps and websites. 

Examples of text from the interface are shown below:
