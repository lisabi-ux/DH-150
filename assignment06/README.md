## Project Description
The current project seeks to provide a user-to-user resale app for furniture. Resale markets currently available tend to focus on clothes or allow all products. The goal of the current project is to create a specialized market for furniture. With this in mind, the app will be designed with the goals, motivations, needs, and pain points of furniture buyers in mind. The target audience are those who buy furniture second hand. This audience tends to be young to middle aged, low to middle class income, live in urban or suburban areas, and have a variety of education levels.
