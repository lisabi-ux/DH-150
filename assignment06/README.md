## Project Description
The current project seeks to provide a user-to-user resale app for furniture. Resale markets currently available tend to focus on clothes or allow all products. The goal of the current project is to create a specialized market for furniture. With this in mind, the app will be designed with the goals, motivations, needs, and pain points of furniture buyers in mind. 

* User Research: The target audience are those who buy furniture second hand. This audience tends to be young to middle aged, low to middle class income, live in urban or suburban areas, and have a variety of education levels. Based on user interviews and market research, I found that users prioritized ease of use and convenience, favoring apps that have quick and simple listing processes. Moreover, feedback and interaction with other users creates a more satisfying user experience, especially for sellers. This is because sellers can become discouraged if they do not recieve any kind of response. For this reason, allowing users to like and interact with listings is beneficial for retaining sellers. It creates a more fulfilling experience, even if they do not end up selling the item. A major pain point of resale markets is establishing trustworthiness. Users are sometimes hesitant to buy items because they are unsure of the quality of the product and the trustworthiness of the seller. For this reason, the app will contain a user profile and review system, which will allow users to have greater assurance of the trustworthiness of other users. 

* Persona & Three Features: Based on the results of the heuristic evaluation and user research, I have designed two personas in order to better explore the goals, motivations, needs, and pain points of users. The first persona is a 21-year-old college student. As a college student with a limited budget, she needs a way to purchase furniture affordably, from a buyer she can trust. Moreover, she wants to save money on the cost of transporting furniture, so she wants to buy local furniture. Threfore, needs a way to filter listings by their location. Her biggest concern is the quality of the furniture. Since refunds are usually not available on resale markets, she is concerned with the condition of the furniture and the trustworthiness of the seller. The second persona is a 40-year-old working mother of two, who is looking to sell some of her family's used furniture. As a working parent who is not especially tech savvy, she needs a platform that provides an easy and quick listing process. Her biggest concern is convenience and ease of use.

 * Based on the findings, I have identified several prime features that would address the needs and pain points of users:

** 1) Filters - Allow users to filter by type, color, condition, price, and location.
** 2) Simple listing process that has pre-set categories and allows you to copy prior listings - This makes listing easier and more convenient.
** 3) User profiles and reviews - This creates greater trustworthiness and less anonymity, which erodes trustworthiness.

* The purpose of this low-fidelity prototype is to begin the implementation of these features and assess the overall usability and functionality of my initial design of the app.
